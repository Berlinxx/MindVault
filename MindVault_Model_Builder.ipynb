    "# ITEC 116: SYSTEM INTEGRATION AND ARCHITECTURE\n",
    "\n",
    "## INTRODUCTION\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Many systems are built to ease, improve, and transform organizations.\n",
    "-   Some organizations have many departments which run systems that are independent of each other.\n",
    "-   And systems built sometimes may not have an abstract view (architecture), which leads to the failure of system interoperability.\n",
    "-   There is a need to have an architectural view of the system as a priority to help in the design to avoid the likeliness of system failure.\n",
    "-   Besides, after the system has been designed and developed in consideration of the size of the organization (i.e., most especially when the organization is large), a need is required to integrate such systems to ensure flexibility, speed, cost, standardization, data integrity, reliability, and robustness.\n",
    "-   This can help Information Technology (IT), energy, and financial services industries, among others, to have an easy-to-use integrated system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## LEARNING OUTCOMES\n",
    "\n",
    "On completion of this course, the students will be able to:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Identify integration issues upfront in the process of System Integration and should be able to identify the best practices that ensure successful System Integration.\n",
    "-   Have an understanding of the technical and business process issues involved in systems integration.\n",
    "\n",
    "## INDICATIVE CONTENT\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The System of Systems Integration Problem\n",
    "    -   Human, Organizational, Societal Cultural, Economic, and Technological aspects;\n",
    "    -   Processes, approaches, drivers, tools, and techniques required for successful SI, critical success factors, and best practices in Systems Integration;\n",
    "    -   The Role of Architectures in Systems Integration;\n",
    "        -   Integration in a System of Systems and a Federation of Systems;\n",
    "    -   Model-Based Architecture, Design, and Integration;\n",
    "-   The theory and practice of business process integration, legacy integration, new systems integration, business-to-business integration, integration of commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) products, interface control and management, testing, integrated program management, integrated Business Continuity Planning (BCP). Specific focus will be given to issues of interface integration and interoperability of systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "## KEY TERMINOLOGIES IN THIS COURSE\n",
    "\n",
    "Various key terminologies shall be used throughout this course as follows:\n",
    "-   System\n",
    "-   Systems thinking\n",
    "-   System Integration\n",
    "-   System Architecture\n",
    "-   Project\n",
    "\n",
    "### SYSTEM\n",
    "\n",
    "-   An array of components designed to accomplish a particular objective according to plan.\n",
    "-   Many sub-systems may be designed which later on are combined together to form a system which is intended to achieve a specific objective which may be set by the Project manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SYSTEMS THINKING\n",
    "\n",
    "Is a way of understanding an entity in terms of its purpose, as three steps. The three major steps followed in systems thinking:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  Identify a containing whole (system), of which the thing to be explained is a part.\n",
    "2.  Explain the behavior or properties of the containing whole.\n",
    "3.  Explain the behavior or properties of the thing to be explained in terms of its role(s) or function(s) within its containing whole (Ackoff, 1981).\n",
    "\n",
    "### SYSTEM INTEGRATION\n",
    "\n",
    "Is the combination of inter-related elements to achieve a common objective(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### System Architecture\n",
    "\n",
    "-   The architecture of a system defines its high-level structure, exposing its gross organization as a collection of interacting components.\n",
    "-   Elements needed to model a software architecture include: Components, Connectors, Systems, Properties, and Styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "## WHAT IS A PROJECT?\n",
    "\n",
    "From the key terms described above, a system developer and architects cannot do anything without first establishing various projects. These projects may be new or existing.\n",
    "\n",
    "So it is inevitable to first understand what a project is, factors that influence the project, who the owners are, and many more as discussed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "### WHERE DO INFORMATION SYSTEMS PROJECTS ORIGINATE (SOURCES OF PROJECTS)?\n",
    "\n",
    "New or changed IS development projects come from problems, opportunities, and directives and are always subject to one or more constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Problems** – may either be current, suspected, or anticipated. Problems are undesirable situations that prevent the business from fully achieving its purpose, goals, and objectives (users discovering real problems with existing IS).\n",
    "2.  **An Opportunity** – is a chance to improve the business even in the absence of specific problems. This means that the business is hoping to create a system that will help it with increasing its revenue, profit, or services, or decreasing its costs.\n",
    "3.  **A Directive** – is a new requirement that is imposed by management, government, or some external influence i.e. are mandates that come from either an internal or external source of the business.\n",
    "\n",
    "### PROJECTS CANNOT BE RUN IN ISOLATION\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Projects must operate in a broad organizational environment.\n",
    "-   Project managers need to take a holistic or systems view of a project and understand how it is situated within the larger organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "### STAKEHOLDERS\n",
    "\n",
    "Stakeholders are the people involved in or affected by project activities. Stakeholders include:\n",
    "-   the project sponsor and project team\n",
    "-   support staff\n",
    "-   customers\n",
    "-   users\n",
    "-   suppliers\n",
    "-   opponents to the project\n",
    "\n",
    "### IMPORTANCE OF STAKEHOLDERS\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Project managers must take time to identify, understand, and manage relationships with all project stakeholders.\n",
    "-   Using the four frames of organizations can help meet stakeholder needs and expectations.\n",
    "-   Senior executives are very important stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### WHAT HELPS PROJECTS SUCCEED?\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the Standish Group’s report “CHAOS 2001: A Recipe for Success,” the following items help IT projects succeed, in order of importance:\n",
    "-   Executive support\n",
    "-   User involvement\n",
    "-   Experienced project manager\n",
    "-   Clear business objectives\n",
    "-   Minimized scope\n",
    "-   Standard software infrastructure\n",
    "-   Firm basic requirements\n",
    "-   Formal methodology\n",
    "-   Reliable estimates\n",
    "\n",
    "### UNDERSTANDING ORGANIZATIONS\n",
    "\n",
    "We can analyze a formal organization using the following 4 (four) frames:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Structural Frame:** Focuses on roles and responsibilities, coordination and control. Organizational charts help define this frame.\n",
    "-   **Political Frame:** Assumes organizations are coalitions composed of varied individuals and interest groups. Conflict and power are key issues.\n",
    "-   **Human Resources Frame:** Focuses on providing harmony between needs of the organization and needs of people.\n",
    "-   **Symbolic Frame:** Focuses on symbols and meanings related to events. Culture is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Most people understand what organizational charts are. Many new managers try to change organizational structure when other changes are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "4 basic organizational structures:\n",
    "-   Functional\n",
    "-   Project-based\n",
    "-   Matrix\n",
    "-   Divisional\n",
    "\n",
    "### BASIC ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURES\n",
    "\n",
    "Organizational structure depends on the company and/or the project. The structure helps define the roles and responsibilities of the members of the department, work group, or organization. It is generally a system of tasks and reporting policies in place to give members of the group a direction when completing projects. A good organizational structure will allow people and groups to work effectively together while developing hard work ethics and attitudes. The four general types of organizational structure are functional, divisional, matrix and project-based.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### FUNCTIONAL STRUCTURE\n",
    "\n",
    "People who do similar tasks, have similar skills and/or jobs in an organization are grouped into a functional structure. The advantages of this kind of structure include quick decision making because the group members are able to communicate easily with each other. People in functional structures can learn from each other easier because they already possess similar skill sets and interests.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### DIVISIONAL STRUCTURE\n",
    "\n",
    "In a divisional structure, the company will coordinate inter-group relationships to create a work team that can readily meet the needs of a certain customer or group of customers. The division of labor in this kind of structure will ensure greater output of varieties of similar products. An example of a divisional structure is geographical, where divisions are set up in regions to work with each other to produce similar products that meet the needs of the individual regions.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### MATRIX STRUCTURE\n",
    "\n",
    "Matrix structures are more complex in that they group people in two different ways:\n",
    "-   by the function they perform and\n",
    "-   by the product team they are working with.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a matrix structure the team members are given more autonomy and expected to take more responsibility for their work. This increases the productivity of the team, fosters greater innovation and creativity, and allows managers to cooperatively solve decision-making problems through group interaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### PROJECT ORGANIZATION STRUCTURE\n",
    "\n",
    "In a project-organizational structure, the teams are put together based on the number of members needed to produce the product or complete the project. The numbers of significantly different kinds of tasks are taken into account when structuring a project in this manner, assuring that the right members are chosen to participate in the project.\n",

    "# Lesson 2: OPERATING SYSTEM\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is an operating system?\n",
    "\n",
    "An operating system is the most important software that runs on a computer. It manages the computer's memory and processes, as well as all of its software and hardware. It also allows you to communicate with the computer without knowing how to speak the computer's language. Without an operating system, a computer is useless.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The operating system's job\n",
    "\n",
    "Your computer's operating system (OS) manages all of the software and hardware on the computer. Most of the time, there are several different computer programs running at the same time, and they all need to access your computer's central processing unit (CPU), memory, and storage. The operating system coordinates all of this to make sure each program gets what it needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **According to Microsoft**\n",
    "> Support for Windows 8.1 ended on January 10, 2023. We recommend you move to a Windows 11 PC to continue to receive security updates from Microsoft. Windows 8 has reached end of support, which means Windows 8 devices no longer receive important security updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of operating systems\n",
    "\n",
    "Operating systems usually come pre-loaded on any computer you buy. Most people use the operating system that comes with their computer, but it's possible to upgrade or even change operating systems. The three most common operating systems for personal computers are Microsoft Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n",
    "\n",
    "### macOS\n",
    "\n",
    "macOS (previously called OS X) is a line of operating systems created by Apple. It comes preloaded on all Macintosh computers, or Macs. Some of the specific versions include Mojave (released in 2018), High Sierra (2017), and Sierra (2016).\n",
    "\n",
    "According to StatCounter Global Stats, macOS users account for less than 10% of global operating systems - much lower than the percentage of Windows users (more than 80%). One reason for this is that Apple computers tend to be more expensive. However, many people do prefer the look and feel of macOS over Windows.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "1. Simple and Powerful user interface\n",
    "2. Fewer Virus attacks\n",
    "3. World class Integration between hardware and software\n",
    "4. Integration of Apple Products\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "1. Expensive\n",
    "2. Harder to upgrade\n",
    "3. No Games\n",
    "\n",
    "image source: usabilitygeek\n",
    "\n",
    "### Linux\n",
    "\n",
    "Linux (pronounced LINN-ux) is a family of open-source operating systems, which means they can be modified and distributed by anyone around the world. This is different from proprietary software like Windows, which can only be modified by the company that owns it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The advantages of Linux are that it is free, and there are many different distributions-or versions-you can choose from.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to StatCounter Global Stats, Linux users account for less than 2% of global operating systems. However, most servers run Linux because it's relatively easy to customize.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "1. Low cost\n",
    "2. Stability\n",
    "3. Flexibility\n",
    "4. Performance\n",
    "5. Choice\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "1. Understanding\n",
    "2. Software\n",
    "3. Ease\n",
    "4. Hardware\n",
    "\n",
    "**Linux - Deepin**\n",
    "image source: geekflare\n",
    "\n",
    "### Microsoft Windows\n",
    "\n",
    "Microsoft created the Windows operating system in the mid-1980s. There have been many different versions of Windows, but the most recent ones are Windows 10 (released in 2015), Windows 8 (2012), Windows 7 (2009), and Windows Vista (2007). Windows comes pre-loaded on most new PCs, which helps to make it the most popular operating system in the world.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pros:**\n",
    "1. Cheap\n",
    "2. Variety Options\n",
    "3. Software availability\n",
    "4. Customizable\n",
    "5. Games\n",
    "6. Upgradable\n",
    "\n",
    "**Cons:**\n",
    "1. Malware and Virus Attacks\n",
    "2. Less Reliable\n",
    "3. Becomes Laggy overtime\n",
    "\n",
    "**Several versions of Windows 11 are available, including:**\n",
    "- Windows 11 Home: intended for home use. It contains all the basic functions an average user needs.\n",
    "- Windows 11 Pro: intended for professionals and businesses. It includes additional features for business use, such as advanced security features and comprehensive management tools.\n",
    "- Windows 11 Enterprise: intended for large organisations and offers the most comprehensive set of features, including advanced security and management tools.\n",
    "- Windows 11 Education: specially designed for education and includes features useful for schools and universities.\n",
    "- Windows 11 IoT Enterprise: a version of Enterprise with the same functionality, but with different mechanisms for licensing and distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows 10 - User Management\n",
    "\n",
    "Like most Windows versions since XP, Windows 10 allows you to log in to different user accounts when using your computer.\n",
    "Step 1 - Open the Start Menu.\n",
    "Step 2 - Click on Settings.\n",
    "Step 3 - From the SETTINGS window, choose Accounts option.\n",
    "Step 4 - In the ACCOUNTS window, choose the account setting you want to configure.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to change your sign-in options, like your password, select Sign-in options. Under Sign-in options, Windows 10 lets you change your password. It also lets you choose when the computer will ask you to sign in.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Windows 10 - Backup & Recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "**File History**\n",
    "File History will perform a back-up of the files located in your libraries (Documents, Pictures, Music, etc.) It allows you to choose a drive, where you can back-up your files and then asks you when to do it.\n",
    "To configure the File History backup, follow these steps:\n",
    "Step 1 - Go to SETTINGS and select Update & security.\n",
    "Step 2 - In the UPDATE & SECURITY window, select Backup.\n",
    "Step 3 - Click \\\"Add a drive\\\" to choose where to store your backup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Windows 7 - Backup & Recovery**\n",
    "This tool, which was removed in Windows 8 and 8.1, was brought back allowing you to perform back-ups and restore data from old Windows 7 backups. However, it also lets to back-up your regular documents on Windows 10.\n",
    "To open the Back-up & Restore, follow these steps:\n",
    "Step 1 - Open the Control Panel by searching for it in the Search bar.\n",
    "Step 2 - After the Control Panel is open, choose Backup and Restore (Windows 7).\n",

    "Step 4 - In the Set up backup window, choose where you want to store your backup.\n",
    "Step 5 - In the next window, you can choose what files you want to backup.\n",
    "Step 6 - In the last window, you can review the settings of your backup and establish the schedule in which you want to perform it.\n",
    "Step 7 - In the end, click Save settings and run backup. The backup will perform at the scheduled time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Creating a System Image**\n",
    "In case your computer failing, Windows 10 offers you some alternatives to restore it to a specific state. One of these alternatives is creating what is called a system image. A system image is a copy of all your system and program files needed for your computer to run properly. You can use this option to store an image of your computer at a specific moment, and use it to restore your computer to that state later.\n",
    "The option to create a system image is in the same Backup and Restore window we discussed before.\n",
    "Step 1 - Open the Backup and Restore window from the Control Panel.\n",
    "Step 2 - On the Backup and Restore window, choose the \\\"Create a system image\\\" option on the left.\n",
    "Step 3 - On the Create a system image window, you can choose where to store the backup from among three places: your hard disk, on DVD's, or in the network.\n",
    "Step 4 - In the next window, just confirm your image settings and click Start backup.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Resetting the PC**\n",
    "Another alternative Windows 10 offers you for system recovery is simply called \\\"Reset this PC\\\". This option will allow you to return your computer to its default factory settings. It will also give you the option of keeping your files or removing everything.\n",
    "To reset your PC, follow these steps:\n",
    "Step 1 - Go to SETTINGS and select Update & security.\n",
    "Step 2 - On the UPDATE & SECURITY window, select Recovery.\n",
    "Step 3 - On the Recovery window, you can click the \\\"Get started\\\" button under Reset this PC.\n",

    "DEFINE SYSTEMS ADMINISTRATION AND IDENTIFY RESPONSIBILITIES\n",
    "\n",
    "image credit: ph.talent.com/salary\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is System Administration\n",
    "\n",
    "System administration refers to the management of one or more hardware and software systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "The task is performed by a system administrator who monitors system health, monitors and allocates system resources like disk space, performs backups, provides user access, manages user accounts, monitors system security and performs many other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a sysadmin?\n",
    "\n",
    "Short for \\\"system administrator\\\", sysadmins are responsible for administration, management, and support activities associated with the IT infrastructure at a multi-user organization.\n",
    "\n",
    "Responsibilities within the domain of IT systems administration can be distributed across different job titles depending on size of the organization or the scope of work required.\n",
    "\n",
    "image credit: BMC\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sysadmin role & responsibilities\n",
    "\n",
    "### User administration\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary responsibility of a sysadmin is to support reliable and effective use of complex IT systems by end users, whether internal employees or external customers. Activities range from managing identities and access to providing dedicated technical support to individual users.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "Sysadmins are responsible for dependable access and availability to IT systems. Sysadmins are therefore required to troubleshoot and fix issues that compromise system performance or access to an IT service.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "Sysadmins are required to maintain records of IT assets usage. To plan for future IT investments and upgrades, you will document:\n",
    "- End-user requests\n",
    "- Business requirements\n",
    "- IT issues\n",
    "\n",
    "Documentation also underpins regulatory compliance.\n",
    "\n",
    "### System health monitoring\n",
    "\n",
    "Most IT issues go unnoticed until the impact reaches end users. Sysadmins therefore monitor system health and identify anomalous network behavior, which may include security-sensitive activities such as unauthorized network access and data transfer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Backup & disaster recovery\n",
    "\n",
    "Sysadmins implement data backup and disaster recovery strategies for different IT systems and SDLC environments. You'll also facilitate end-users in accessing data that may have been deleted or unavailable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Activities may involve:\n",
    "- Implementing automated software solutions\n",
    "- Replacing hardware and software components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Application compatibility\n",
    "\n",
    "Sysadmins support various IT teams to ensure that software systems and feature releases are compatible with the IT infrastructure. For example, as sysadmin you may:\n",
    "- Testing server load performance\n",
    "- Install/upgrade hardware components\n",
    "\n",
    "### Web service administration & configurations\n",
    "\n",
    "Sysadmins regularly perform web service administration and configuration management activities, including ensuring that configuration changes are documented and follow organizational policies associated with access and cybersecurity.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Network administration\n",
    "\n",
    "To maintain network integrity, sysadmins ensure that network interactions follow organizational policies and protocols. (A background in network engineering may be required to perform mission-critical network administration activities.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Security administration\n",
